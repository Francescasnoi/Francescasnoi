- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Francescasnoi
I'm a Master's graduate in Biomedical Engineering on a journey towards the realm of data analysis.
Passionate about technology and determined to become a Data Analyst, I'm exploring the world of statistical analysis
and its practical application in the data field. Here, I share the projects and skills I'm developing during this exciting transition.
